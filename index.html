    <h1>Welcome to my blog!</h1>

    <p>
        Here you'll find my essential notes used in <strong>pentesting</strong>, as well as study materials for certifications like 
        <strong>OSCP</strong>, <strong>PNPT</strong>, and <strong>CPTS</strong>.
        I also document walkthroughs of machines from <strong>Hack The Box</strong>, <strong>TryHackMe</strong>, and much more.
    </p>

    <p>
        These notes are a mix of curated knowledge and my personal insights â€” continuously updated as I learn.

    <p>
        Feel free to explore and learn along with me!
