## Writeups That Stick

Doing machines on **Hack The Box** or **TryHackMe** is a great way to sharpen your skills — but for me, the real learning happens when I **write things down**.

These writeups aren’t just walkthroughs. They’re my personal way of breaking down each challenge, figuring out what worked (and what didn’t), and capturing the "aha!" moments. I don’t just want to *complete* a box — I want to understand it deeply enough to explain it clearly.

That’s why I write them:  
- To revisit techniques and tools later.  
- To spot patterns and common pitfalls.  
- To reflect on what I’ve learned and how I approached the problem.  

If you’re working through these same boxes, maybe my notes will help you too — just like I’ve learned a ton from the community. But remember: **don’t just read**.  
Try, tweak, experiment. Then write your own.

Because that’s how it really sticks.
