## Hey, I'm Kar0n 

I'm a cybersecurity enthusiast and aspiring ethical hacker, currently focused on learning **penetration testing** and **offensive security**.  
This blog is my personal knowledge base — built to help me study, stay organized, and grow in the field.

I hold a **Master's degree in Cybersecurity** from **UNS Łódź (University of Applied Sciences, Poland)**.

### What I do

- Practice **web**, **network**, and **Active Directory** exploitation  
- Study for certifications like **OSCP**, **PNPT**, and **CPTS**  
- Solve labs and machines from **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**  
- Document notes, cheatsheets, and walkthroughs for future reference  
- Learn, break, fix, and learn again  

### Why I Built This Site

There’s a ton of great material online — I use it too — but I believe that  
**writing your own notes is the fastest way to actually learn**.

I collect, adapt, and simplify content to suit how *I* learn best.  
This site is my external brain, and if it helps someone else along the way — even better.

### Goals

- Achieve mastery in core pentesting areas  
- Earn top-tier certifications  
- Contribute back to the infosec community  
- Never stop learning
