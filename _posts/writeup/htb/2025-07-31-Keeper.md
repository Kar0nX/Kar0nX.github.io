redirecting (we need to add /etc/hosts) Tried common combinations but without results

searching google for default credentials I found root:password which works.

in /Admin/Users i found new username lnorgaard

also in search I found recently viewed ticket with same username.

![](https://kar0nx.github.io/assets/images/writeup/Pasted image 20250827163055.png)

Nothing more in ticket but I found Comment about lnorgaard user in /Admin/Users/Modify with password: Welcome2023!

logged as Inorgaard to webpanel but nothing special was there so I tried ssh and here we go:

## Gaining  access

Starting with linpeas I spot mysql localport open but

better one to start with is in user home directory, a zip file:

## Privilege escalation

after copy files to my machine and extracting zip we have keepass dump file and .kdbx file, tried to crack password via john but no hit with rockyou so I search for exploits and I found: 
https://github.com/matro7sh/keepass-dump-masterkey
and I got results;  ● is unknown character

Searching google with this letters I found something like "Rødgrød med fløde" which may be a password.

![](https://kar0nx.github.io/assets/images/writeup/Pasted image 20250827170812.png)

let's try this ( we have keepass2 in kali repo), so start, select file passcodes.kdbx and paste password and we got access

### Putty to id_rsa (ssh)

password didn't work with ssh root but in note we have puTTY file, let's save it on our machine and convert it via puttygen

![](https://kar0nx.github.io/assets/images/writeup/Pasted image 20250827172655.png)

```
puttygen putty -O private-openssh -o id_rsa
chmod 600 id_rsa
ssh -i id_rsa root@10.10.11.227
```
