# POP Commands

| POP Command | Description                                                                |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `USER uid`  | Log in to the POP server using the username specified by "uid".           |
| `PASS password` | Provide the password specified by "password" for the current user.       |
| `STAT`      | Request the server to return the number of messages in the mailbox and the total size of the mailbox in bytes. |
| `LIST`      | Request the server to list all messages in the mailbox along with their sizes in bytes. |
| `RETR n`    | Request the server to retrieve and display the entire message number "n". |
